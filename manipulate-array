remove(element): Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the list.
clear(): Removes all elements from the list.
Accessing Elements:
Indexing: Access elements by their index, e.g., my_list[0].
Slicing: Access a subset of elements using slice notation, e.g., my_list[1:4].
index(element): Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element.
count(element): Returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the list.
Sorting and Reversing:
sort(): Sorts the elements of the list in ascending order.
reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements in the list.
Copying and Joining:
copy(): Returns a shallow copy of the list.
join(iterable): Concatenates the elements of the iterable with the list.
Other Operations:
len(): Returns the number of elements in the list.
min(): Returns the smallest element in the list.
max(): Returns the largest element in the list.
sum(): Returns the sum of all elements in the list.

del nums1[m:] -- HEre every element after the count of m, will be deleted from the list
       nums[:] = unique_nums ; when you run this code, the array nums will be replaced by another array unique_nums content. 
       also, whenever you call the nums array, the new array is waht will show up. ALso keep in mind that unique nums is a new array.
strip() this will remove all spaces/white space in the front and back of a given string
split(" ") this will seperate the strings or elements wherever it sights the given parameter.
here space is the passed parameter
